import { orderJson } from './data.js'

// Create a function which receives orderJson as a parameter and returns two values
//   1.) How many days in the past the order was submitted
//      Hint: Utilize the JS Date method, use .getTime() to compare difference of the dates
//          : There are 86,400,000 ms in a day
        
//   2.) A boolean value whether or not the order was submitted "today"
